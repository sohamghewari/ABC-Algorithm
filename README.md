# ABC-Algorithm-
ABC Algorithm stands for Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and is an optimization technique to solve problems. In this project, I wrote a code in c++ to find the global minimum of the Matyas function
Matyas function is one of the benchmark functions. The ABC Algorithm deals with optimizing the solution of the function by iterative method. The code thus helps us find the global minimum of the function
